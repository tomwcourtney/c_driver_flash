1. Rename the folder from tdd_template to your driver that you're building.
2. Put your source code in src and inc
3. Put your spies in test_harness->spies
4. Put your fakes in test_harness->fakes
5. Put your tests in test_harness->tests
6. The doxyfile only produces docs for what's in the inc folder. You might need to change the project name.
